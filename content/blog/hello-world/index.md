Check it out, I'm a blog post on a static site, thanks to GatsbyJS! Neat! Lately I've found I miss blogging in some form, so here's to the start of this new site where I can share lists, game reviews or new things on the development front I'm excited about! 

Have this great Captain Marvel image to get us started.
