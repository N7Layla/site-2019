Two of my favorite things are making lists and sharing love for media I've recently consumed. Since I have some spare time over the holidays I thought I would put together a small post highlighting some of my favorite releases of 2019, be it in reading, viewing, listening or gaming.

The list, in no particular order:

 * Lady Lavender by Samantha Lin 📘
 * Arcade Spirits 🎮
 * Wave Your Flags by PHILDEL 💿
 * Russian Doll 📺
 * The Mandalorian 📺
 * Colors in Black by NELL 💿
 * Fire Emblem: Three Houses 🎮
 * Captain Marvel 🎬
 * Sulwe by Lupita Nyong'o 📘
 * Love + Fear by MARINA 💿
 * Good Omens 📺
 * Puzzle 9 Pieces by ARRAN 💿
 * Map of the Soul: Persona by BTS 💿
 * Watchmen 📺
 * Always Be My Maybe 🎬

You can tell my leanings this year were heavy towards music and television. Want to share some of yours? Feel free to drop me a tweet!
